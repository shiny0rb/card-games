# Card Tricks, poker, pontoon, solitaire, texas holdem

Basically a mess around with a deck of cards to create some games and improve skills in each one.

First do this is in python, then do it in javascript and then in android

basically very simple at first then more complex, add features etc. 

just deal five cards then work out which hand is the best.
